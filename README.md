# IOT-Cyber-Security
**Research Objective**â€”The seminar aims to investigate the impact of integrating IoT tools on security in corporate information systems over the past five years. The study explores the common vulnerabilities among IoT components over the past five years, best practices related to IoT device security, identifying and examining common vulnerabilities, and gaining a deeper understanding of the importance and frequency of downloading updates to IoT components.

**Background** - The widespread adoption of IoT technology has raised concerns about the security of corporate information systems. As IoT tools become increasingly integrated, it is essential to understand the vulnerabilities they may present and identify effective security measures to mitigate risks.

**Research Methods** - For each research method used in this study: the design, method, sampled population, and sample size (for a correlational design) or manipulation (for an experimental design)
The study uses two main methods: database analysis and benchmarking.
Database analysis is a correlational research set that includes extracting information from the VARIOT database. The database contains a wealth of details on documenting and analyzing vulnerabilities in IoT components, examining vulnerabilities, and assessing their severity. Throughout the study, we focused on data from the last five years and the seven most common weaknesses in the database. This sample contains approximately 3452 records.
Comparative analysis, a correlational research set that included comparing 4 popular IoT devices from leading manufacturers, Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung Bixby, based on predefined parameters to measure their security levels and according to various characteristics.

**Findings** - The study reveals the seven most common weaknesses in IoT components and their severity level: Buffer Error, XSS, Input Validation Error, Information Disclosure, and more. Alongside these weaknesses, the study found that there is a clear common denominator based on the characteristics by which we measured. These characteristics are what give these vulnerabilities their prominent position. The study also raised recommended practices for securing IoT devices, including implementing strong authentication mechanisms, encrypting data transmissions, and establishing a clear security policy. In addition, the study highlighted that software updates and maintaining updated software are essential to minimize the vulnerability of organizational information systems and can significantly increase security.

**Conclusions** - Integrating IoT tools into organizational information systems requires careful consideration of security implications. By implementing recommended security practices, organizations can improve their security level and reduce potential risks associated with IoT integration.
Contribution of the study - This study contributes to understanding security challenges related to IoT and provides practical recommendations for organizations, researchers, and stakeholders. The findings can help organizations improve the security of their information systems, protect sensitive data, and reduce the risk of cyber attacks. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of collaboration and proactive measures to address IoT vulnerabilities effectively.
